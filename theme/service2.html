                    <p class="section-erc-content">Regular oil and filter changes are crucial for maintaining your
                        vehicle's performance and longevity. At our trusted car workshop in Glen Burnie, MD, we offer expert
                        oil change and filter services to keep your car running smoothly.</p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content">An oil and filter change not only extends your car's lifespan but
                        also helps prevent costly repairs in the future. Dirty or insufficient oil can lead to severe
                        engine problems and trigger warning lights.</p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content">As your premier automotive service provider, we understand the
                        importance of timely oil changes. Dirty oil compromises engine efficiency and can damage
                        internal components over time.</p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content">Our oil change and filter service ensure that your car receives
                        high-quality engine oil, promoting optimal engine performance and reducing harmful emissions.

                    <p class="section-erc-content">Preventive care ensures the safe and reliable performance of your
                        car. Regular service and maintenance are crucial to make sure your car always runs at its
                        optimum level.</p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content">We know you're thinking quick and fast when it comes to oil changes.
                        That's fine, but things have evolved over the years. Now, more than ever, complete vehicle
                        inspections are an integral part of the oil change. Our shop will look at your tires, look under
                        the body of the vehicle, peek through your wheels to look at the brakes, check your wipers, and
                        top off your fluids on each oil change service.</p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content">We want to keep you and your family safe! This will be done by an
                        experienced technician, not a trainee. This tech works at a guaranteed pay, not on commission so
                        there is no incentive to upsell services or recommend a service that's not necessary. Trust the
                        service.</p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content"><strong>When to Change Your Oil Every 5,000 Miles</strong></p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content">Depending on the age of your vehicle, the type of oil you use, and
                        your past driving conditions, oil change intervals vary. It used to be normal to change the oil
                        every 3,000 miles, but with modern lubricants, most engines today have recommended oil change
                        intervals of every 5,000 miles.</p>
                    <p class="section-erc-content">Get in the habit of checking your oil at least once a month to ensure
                        your car's not leaking or burning oil. If the level is low, add oil. If your car has one of the
                        aforementioned oil monitoring systems, though, you might not have a dipstick to check the oil.
